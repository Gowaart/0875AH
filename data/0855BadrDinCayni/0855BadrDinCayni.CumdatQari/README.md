## 1. Describe why you chose this specific version of the text. Why others, in your opinion, are worse?

All were quite similar to me. pagination, structure, length, so I just chose shamela by chance

## 2. Which edition you used for collation? How close the text to the edition? Is pagination the same?

pagination is the same 
there is somtimes numbers for headlines which are differently between the pdf and the text.


## 3. Have you noticed any typos? If yes, how many? (Guesstimate is fine)

V11P66 or V14P245 )
